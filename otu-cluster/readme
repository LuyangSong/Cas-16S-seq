The 16S-seq results were processing using VSEARCH pipline and the results were summarized using R package.

Required files:
 Raw sequencing results (available on https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa/s/project/PRJCA001629)
 root_soil_sample-seq.info.vsearch.csv sample-meta-data (* Note)
 vsearch_sample_info.csv    information of pair-end sequencing files, used in BASH script

1.Raw data processing and OTU clustering
   vsearch.pipeline.bash  BASH script used in 16S-seq data processing
 
It generates OTU tables and OTUs represented rice Mt-16S-rRNA
   all.otutab100.txt   OTU table
   all.otu100.mt2.txt  mitochondrial OTUs or its nuclear genome homologs
   vs.pipline.summary100.csv        summary of reads processing and OTU clustering


2. R codes to summarizing the OTU table
    vsearch100.analysis.Git-hub.R    The R script i used to analyze the OTU table and draw the plot for the manuscript.

 
*Note.
bS1_4, is the no-input control to monitor contamination of reagents
bS1_1, bS1-2, bS1_3 are renames as Bs1048-4, Bs1048-5, Bs1048-6
C_BS1_1, C_BS1_2, C_BS1_3 are also named as Bs1048-1, Bs1048-2, Bs1048-3
